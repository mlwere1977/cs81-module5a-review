# REFLECTION ON HOBBY TRACKER

## What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

- I discovered how array data analysis and summarization can be facilitated by higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. 
- I learned how each function changes or filters the hobby log by reading and commenting on each line. I also learned how chaining these functions can make code more powerful and readable.

## What was the most confusing part?

- Understanding how the `Set` object eliminates duplicates when identifying unique hobbies was the most perplexing aspect. 
- The need to spread the Set back into an array was initially unclear. 
- After leaving a comment, I discovered that it's a typical JavaScript pattern to retrieve unique values from an array.
