## Overview

This project is a straightforward JavaScript application that assists Mukwaya Lwere (and friends!) in monitoring their weekly hobbies. It records the hobbies pursued daily, the amount of time spent on them, and the mood of each session. The code analyzes the data using higher-order functions to provide answers to queries such as: 
- How much time was spent on hobbies overall?
- Which unusual pastimes were enjoyed?
- Which sessions lasted the longest?
- What was the frequency of a particular mood?
